BioReact

BioReact is a full-stack system for the BMES bioreactor. BMES at OSU is a club that brings networking opportunities to students and allows hands-on collaboration on designing and developing projects relevant to the biomedical industry. One of the projects in this club is to develop a more affordable bioreactor. Our project contains both the frontend to control the machine and the backend that can handle the automation for it.

Frontend: Imgyeong Lee
Backend: Anh (Frank) Nguyen
