MEMO

- I think we need to add some redux things for selection & management of recipes.
- There is a sample data in data directory.
- The page styling is not dynamic style (so sad)
- For now, if you click the links in the sidebar on the /load page, you will navigate to /recipes/:num page which is for recipe management.
